Simple building block script for inspecting packets flying across an interface/pcap file. Concatenates fragmented packets. Prints a 1 line packet summary if the packet has a TCP layer and a load. Meant to be built out to find specific information from packets.


Auto-detect the interface to sniff

```sudo python net-sniffer.py```


Choose eth0 as the interface

```sudo python net-sniffer.py -i eth0```


Read from pcap

```sudo python net-sniffer.py -p pcapfile```
